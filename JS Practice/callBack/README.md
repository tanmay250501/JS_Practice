### Callback Functions in JavaScript

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of action. Callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations such as data fetching, event handling, and more.

#### Example: Simple Callback

```javascript
function greet(name, callback) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
    callback();
}

function sayGoodbye() {
    console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greet("Alice", sayGoodbye);
```

In this example:

1. **`greet`**: A function that takes a `name` and a `callback` function as parameters.
2. **`sayGoodbye`**: A function that prints "Goodbye!" to the console.
3. **`greet("Alice", sayGoodbye)`**: Calls `greet` with "Alice" and the `sayGoodbye` function. After greeting "Alice", it invokes `sayGoodbye`.

### Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript

A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as a result. Higher-order functions are a key feature in functional programming.

#### Example: Higher-Order Function

```javascript
function multiplyBy(factor) {
    return function(number) {
        return number * factor;
    };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
const triple = multiplyBy(3);

console.log(double(5)); // 10
console.log(triple(5)); // 15
```

In this example:

1. **`multiplyBy`**: A higher-order function that takes a `factor` as an argument and returns a new function.
2. **`double`**: A function created by `multiplyBy(2)`, which doubles a number.
3. **`triple`**: A function created by `multiplyBy(3)`, which triples a number.
4. **`double(5)`** and **`triple(5)`**: Calls the created functions with `5`, resulting in `10` and `15` respectively.

### Callback Functions in Practice

Callback functions are commonly used for asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API.

#### Example: Fetching Data with Callbacks

```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        const data = "Sample Data";
        callback(data);
    }, 2000);
}

function handleData(data) {
    console.log("Received data:", data);
}

fetchData(handleData);
```

In this example:

1. **`fetchData`**: Simulates an asynchronous operation using `setTimeout`, which calls the `callback` function with some data after 2 seconds.
2. **`handleData`**: A function that processes the data and logs it to the console.
3. **`fetchData(handleData)`**: Initiates the data fetching operation, and `handleData` is called when the data is ready.

### Higher-Order Functions in Practice

Higher-order functions are often used with array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

#### Example: Array Methods with Higher-Order Functions

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubled = numbers.map(function(number) {
    return number * 2;
});

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function(number) {
    return number % 2 === 0;
});

const sum = numbers.reduce(function(total, number) {
    return total + number;
}, 0);

console.log(doubled);       // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
console.log(evenNumbers);   // [2, 4]
console.log(sum);           // 15
```

In this example:

1. **`numbers.map`**: A higher-order function that applies the provided function to each element of the array, returning a new array with the results.
2. **`numbers.filter`**: A higher-order function that applies the provided function to each element of the array, returning a new array with elements that pass the test.
3. **`numbers.reduce`**: A higher-order function that applies the provided function to each element of the array, accumulating a single result.

### Conclusion

- **Callback Functions**: Used to handle asynchronous operations, allowing you to pass a function as an argument to be executed later.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results, enabling functional programming patterns in JavaScript.

Both concepts are fundamental in JavaScript and are extensively used in both synchronous and asynchronous programming.
